# gtaV-heist-manager
The goal of this project is providing an interface that helps you and your friends to better organize heists in GTA V.

The heists were added to GTA V Online in the Heists Update in 2015, adding 5 heists each of them with their amount of setup missions.

Three more heists were added with others DLC's, one in 2017, one in 2019 and the last one in 2020.

We have as goals for our interface:

- Calculate the amount of money necessary for preping to the heist and the amount of money each player will win at the end. Giving the heist financer the amount the put initially
- Guide to every part of the heist, from the setup missions to the heist itself
- Show the requirements for each heist
